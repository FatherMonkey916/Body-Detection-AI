# AI-Powered Clothing Fit Finder for Shopify

This project helps users find well-fitting clothes on Shopify using artificial intelligence. With just a single front-facing photo, the system extracts precise body measurements and suggests clothes that match the user's real body size.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The application uses computer vision to analyze a user's body shape and provide personalized clothing recommendations. It seamlessly integrates with Shopify to enhance the online shopping experience.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📸 **Photo-Based Measurement**: Users simply upload one clear front photo in well-fitting clothes.
- 📏 **AI Body Measurement**: The system automatically detects key body points and estimates measurements like waist, hips, and arms.
- 🛍️ **Smart Shopify Integration**: Measurements are sent to Shopify, where size-matched clothing is recommended.
- 💡 **No Extra Hardware**: No need for special cameras or equipment—just one photo is enough.
